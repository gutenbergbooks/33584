<h3><a name="THE_FEMINIST_MOVEMENT" id="THE_FEMINIST_MOVEMENT">THE FEMINIST MOVEMENT</a></h3>


<p>The feminist movement can be dealt
with in two ways: it can be treated as
a sociological abstraction, and discussed at
length in heavy monographs; or it can be
taken as the sum of the action of a lot of
women, and taken account of in the lives of
individual women. The latter way would
be called "journalistic," had not the late
William James used it in his "Varieties of
Religious Experience." It is a method
which preserves the individual flavor, the
personal tone and color, which, after all, are
the life of any movement. It is, therefore,
the method I have chosen for this book. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>The ten women whom I have chosen are
representative: they give the quality of the
woman's movement of today. Charlotte
Perkins Gilman&mdash;Jane Addams&mdash;Emmeline
Pankhurst&mdash;Olive Schreiner&mdash;Isadora
Duncan&mdash;Beatrice Webb&mdash;Emma Goldman&mdash;Margaret
Dreier Robins&mdash;Ellen
Key: surely in these women, [see also the chapter "Freewomen and Dora Marsden."] if anywhere,
is to be found the soul of modern feminism!</p>

<p>One may inquire why certain other names
are not included. There is Maria Montessori,
for instance. Her ideas on the education
of children are of the utmost importance,
and their difference from those of
Froebel is another illustration of the difference
between the practical minds of women
and the idealistic minds of men. But Madame
Montessori's relation to the feminist
movement is, after all, ancillary. A tremendous
lot remains to be done in the way of
cooperation for the management of households
and the education of children before
women who are wives and mothers will be
set free to take their part in the work of the
outside world. But it is the setting of mothers
free, and not the specific kind of education
which their children are to receive, which
is of interest to us here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>Again, one may inquire why, since I have
not blinked the fact that the feminist movement
is making for a revolution of values in
sex&mdash;why I have not included any woman
who has distinguished herself by defying
antiquated conventions which are supposed
to rule the relations of the sexes. This
requires a serious answer. The adjustment
of one's social and personal relations, so far
as may be, to accord with one's own convictions&mdash;that
is not feminism, in my opinion:
it is only common sense. The attempt to
discover how far social laws and traditions
must be changed to accord with the new
position of women in society&mdash;that is a
different thing, and I have dealt with it in
the paper on Ellen Key.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>Another reason is my belief that it is with
woman as producer that we are concerned
in a study of feminism, rather than with
woman as lover. The woman who finds her
work will find her love&mdash;and I do not doubt
will cherish it bravely. But the woman who
sets her love above everything else I would
gently dismiss from our present consideration
as belonging to the courtesan type.</p>

<p>It is not very well understood what the
courtesan really is, and so I pause to describe
her briefly. It is not necessary to
transgress certain moral customs to be a
courtesan; on the other hand, the term may
accurately be applied to women of irreproachable
morals. There are some women
who find their destiny in the bearing and
rearing of children, others who demand independent
work like men, and still others who
make a career of charming, stimulating, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>comforting men. These types, of course,
merge and combine; and then there is that
vast class of women who belong to none of
these types&mdash;who are not good for anything!</p>

<p>The first of these types may be called the
mother type, the second the worker type,
and the third&mdash;the kind of women which is
not drawn either to motherhood or to work,
but which is greatly attracted to men and
which possesses special qualities of sympathy,
stimulus, and charm, and is content
with the more or less disinterested exercise
of these qualities&mdash;this may without prejudice
be called the courtesan type. It will be
seen that the courtesan qualities may find
play as well within legal marriage as without,
and that the transgression of certain
moral customs is only incidental to the type.
Where circumstances encourage it, and
where the moral tradition is weakened by
experience or temperament, the moral customs
will be transgressed: but it is the
human qualities of companionship, and not
the economic basis of that companionship,
which is the essential thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>When a girl with such qualities marries,
and she usually marries, much depends upon
the character of her husband. If her husband
appreciates her, if he does not expect
her to give up her career of charming
straightway, and restrict herself to cooking,
sewing, and the incubating of babies; and,
furthermore, if he does not baffle those qualities
in his wife by sheer failure in his own
career, then there is a happy and virtuous
marriage. Otherwise, there is separation or
divorce, and the woman sometimes becomes
the companion of another man without the
sanction of law. But she has been, it will
be perceived, a courtesan all along. And
while I do not wish to seem to deprecate her
comfortable qualities, she does not come in
the scope of this inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>But there is another figure which I wish
I had been able to include. Not wishing to
involve my publisher in a libel suit, I refrain.
She is the young woman of the leisure class,
whose actions, as represented to us in the
yellow journals, shock or divert us, according
to our temperaments. I confess to
having the greatest sympathy for her, and
in her endeavor to create a livelier, a more
hilarious and human morale, she is doing, I
feel, a real service to the cause of women.
Our American pseudo-aristocracy is capable
to teach us, despite its fantastic excesses,
how to play. And emancipation from
middle-class standards of taste, morality,
and intellect is, so far as it goes, a
good thing. "Too many cocktails," a lady
averred to me the other day, "is better than
smugness; risque conversation far better
than none at all." And that celebrated
"public-be-damned" attitude of the pseudo-aristocracy
is a great moral improvement
over the cowardly, hysterical fear of the
neighbors which prevails in the middle class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>But, if I sympathize with the "hell raising"
tendency&mdash;no other phrase describes
it&mdash;of the young woman of the leisure class,
I have more pity than sympathy for the
one who is trying to realize the ideal of the
"salon." For she must, after sad experience
and bitter disillusionment, be content
with the tawdry activities which, relieved by
the orgiastic outbreaks alluded to above,
constitute social life in America.</p>

<p>The establishment of a salon is, in itself,
a healthful ideal. If civilization were destroyed,
and rebuilt on any plan, the tradition
of the salon would be a good starting
point for the creation of a medium of satisfying
social intercourse. Social intercourse
we must have, or the best of us lapse into
boorishness. The ego only properly functions
in contact with other and various egos.
So that, in any case, we should have to have
something in the nature of our contemporary
"society." All the more do we need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
"society" at present, since those ancient
institutions, the church and the caf&#233;, have
almost entirely lost the character of real
social centers.</p>

<p>Recognizing this need, and supposing the
best intentions in the world, what can people
do at present in the creation of a "society"
which shall be useful to the community instead
of a laughing stock for the intelligent?</p>

<p>That is a fair question. Many an ambitious
and idealistic young American matron
has tried to solve it. She has found that the
materials were a little scarce&mdash;the people
who could talk brilliantly are very rare. But
brilliancy is always a miracle, and it can be
dispensed with. The real trouble lies elsewhere.</p>

<p>The fact is that in our present industrial
system the need for social life is in inverse
ratio to the opportunity for it. The people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
who need social intercourse are those who do
hard work. The people who have most
money and leisure, the most opportunity for
social life, are those who have too much of it,
anyway. Moreover&mdash;and this is an important
point&mdash;no one profits less by leisure
and money than those who have a great deal
of it. Consequently, the basis of "society"
today is a class of people naturally and inevitably
inferior. It is this class which
dominates "society," which gives the tone,
and which sets the standard. So long, then,
as "society" is dominated by inferiors, intelligent
men and women will not be inclined
to waste what time they have for social intercourse
in such stupid activities as those that
"society" can furnish. They will flock by
themselves, and if they become undemocratic
and unsocial as a result, that will appear to
them the lesser evil. So that, however
catholic our standards, the saloniere, as a
bounden failure, has no place in this transcript
of feminism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>One thing will be observed with regard to
these following papers&mdash;though they are
imbued with an intense interest in women,
they are devoid of the spirit of Romance.
I mean that attitude toward woman which
accepts her sex as a miraculous justification
for her existence, the belief that being a
woman is a virtue in itself, apart from the
possession of other qualities: in short,
woman-worship. The reverence for woman
as virgin, or wife, or mother, irrespective of
her capacities as friend or leader or servant&mdash;that
is Romance. It is an attitude which,
discovered in the Middle Ages, has added a
new glamour to existence. To woman as a
superior being, a divinity, one may look for
inspiration&mdash;and receive it. For those who
cannot be fired by an abstract idea, she gives
to imagination "some pure light in human
form to fix it." She is the sustenance of
hungry souls. Believe in her and you shall
be saved&mdash;so runs the gospel of Petrarch,
of Dante, of Browning, of George Meredith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>So runs not mine. I have hearkened to
the voice of modern science, which tells me
that woman is an inferior being, with a weak
body, a stunted mind, poor in creative power,
poor in imagination, poor in critical capacity&mdash;a
being who does not know how to
work, nor how to talk, nor how to play! I
hope no one will imagine that I am making
these charges up maliciously out of my own
head: such a notion would indicate that a
century of pamphleteering on the woman
question had made no impression on a mind
saturated in the ideology of popular fiction.</p>

<p>But&mdash;I have hearkened even more
eagerly to the voice of sociology, which
tells me of woman's wonderful possibilities.
It is with these possibilities that this book
is, in the main, concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>But first the explanation of why I, a man,
write these articles on feminism. It involves
the betrayal of a secret: the secret, that is,
of the apparent indifference or even hostility
of men toward the woman's movement. The
fact is, as has been bitterly recited by the
rebellious leaders of their sex, that women
have always been what man wanted them to
be&mdash;have changed to suit his changing
ideals. The fact is, furthermore, that the
woman's movement of today is but another
example of that readiness of women to adapt
themselves to a masculine demand.</p>

<p>Men are tired of subservient women; or,
to speak more exactly, of the seemingly subservient
woman who effects her will by
stealth&mdash;the pretty slave with all the slave's
subtlety and cleverness. So long as it was
possible for men to imagine themselves masters,
they were satisfied. But when they
found out that they were dupes, they wanted
a change. If only for self-protection, they
desired to find in woman a comrade and an
equal. In reality they desired it because it
promised to be more fun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>So that we have as the motive behind the
rebellion of women an obscure rebellion of
men. Why, then, have men appeared hostile
to the woman's rebellion? Because what
men desire are real individuals who have
achieved their own freedom. It will not do
to pluck freedom like a flower and give it to
the lady with a polite bow. She must fight
for it.</p>

<p>We are, to tell the truth, a little afraid
that unless the struggle is one which will call
upon all her powers, which will try her to the
utmost, she will fall short of becoming that
self-sufficient, able, broadly imaginative and
healthy-minded creature upon whom we
have set our masculine desire.</p>

<p>It is, then, as a phase of the great human
renaissance inaugurated by men that the
woman's movement deserves to be considered.
And what more fitting than that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
man should sit in judgment upon the contemporary
aspects of that movement, weighing
out approval or disapproval! Such
criticism is not a masculine impertinence but
a masculine right, a right properly pertaining
to those who are responsible for the
movement, and whose demands it must
ultimately fulfill.</p>

<h3><a name="CHARLOTTE_PERKINS_GILMAN" id="CHARLOTTE_PERKINS_GILMAN"></a>CHARLOTTE PERKINS GILMAN</h3>


<p>Of the women who represent and
carry on this many-sided movement
today, the first to be considered from this
masculine viewpoint should, I think, be
Charlotte Perkins Gilman. For she is, to
a superficial view, the most intransigent
feminist of them all, the one most exclusively
concerned with the improvement of
the lot of woman, the least likely to compromise
at the instance of man, child, church,
state, or devil.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gilman is the author of "Women
and Economics" and several other books of
theory, "What Diantha Did" and several
other books of fiction; she is the editor and
publisher of a remarkable journal, The Forerunner,
the whole varied contents of which
is written by herself; she has a couple of
plays to her credit, and she has published a
book of poems. If in spite of all this publicity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
it is still possible to misunderstand the
attitude of Mrs. Gilman, I can only suppose
it to be because her poetry is less well known
than her prose. For in this book of verse,
"In This Our World," Mrs. Gilman has so
completely justified herself that no man
need ever be afraid of her&mdash;nor any woman
who, having a lingering tenderness for the
other sex, would object to living in a beehive
world, full of raging efficient females,
with the males relegated to the position of
drones.</p>

<p>Of course, I do but jest when I speak of
this fear; but there is, to the ordinary male,
something curiously objectionable at the
first glance in Mrs. Gilman's arguments,
whether they are for co&#246;perative kitchens or
for the labor of women outside the home.
And the reason for that objection lies precisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
in the fact that her plans seem to be
made in a complete forgetfulness of him and
his interests. It all has the air of a feminine
plot. The co&#246;perative kitchens, and the
labor by which women's economic independence
is to be achieved, seem the means to
an end.</p>

<p>And so they are. But the end, as revealed
in Mrs. Gilman's poems, is that one
which all intelligent men must desire. I do
not know whether or not the more elaborate
co&#246;perative schemes of Mrs. Gilman are
practical; and I fancy that she rather exaggerates
the possibilities of independent work
for women who have or intend to have children.
But the spirit behind these plans is
one which cannot but be in the greatest
degree stimulating and beneficent in its
effect upon her sex.</p>

<p>For Mrs. Gilman is, first of all, a poet, an
idealist. She is a lover of life. She rejoices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
in beauty and daring and achievement, in
all the fine and splendid things of the world.
She does not merely disapprove of the contemporary
"home" as wasteful and inefficient&mdash;she
hates it because it vulgarizes life.
In this "home," this private food-preparing
and baby-rearing establishment, she sees a
machine which breaks down all that is good
and noble in women, which degrades and
pettifies them. The contrast between the
instinctive ideals of young women and the
sordid realities into which housekeeping
plunges them is to her intolerable. And in
the best satirical verses of modern times she
ridicules these unnecessary shames. In one
spirited piece she points out that the soap-vat,
the pickle-tub, even the loom and wheel,
have lost their sanctity, have been banished
to shops and factories:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But bow ye down to the Holy Stove,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Altar of the Home!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>The real feeling of Mrs. Gilman is revealed
in these lines, which voice, indeed, the
angry mood of many an outraged housewife
who finds herself the serf of a contraption
of cast-iron:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... We toil to keep the altar crowned<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With dishes new and nice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Art and Love, and Time and Truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We offer up, with Health and Youth<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In daily sacrifice.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mrs. Gilman is not under the illusion that
the conditions of work outside the home are
perfect; she is, indeed, a socialist, and as
such is engaged in the great task of revolutionizing
the basis of modern industry.
But she has looked into women's souls, and
turned away in disgust at the likeness of a
dirty kitchen which those souls present.</p>

<p>Into these lives corrupted by the influences
of the "home" nothing can come unspoiled&mdash;nothing
can enter in its original stature
and beauty. She says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Birth comes. Birth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breathing re-creation of the earth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All earth, all sky, all God, life's sweet deep whole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Newborn again to each new soul!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh, are you? What a shame! Too bad, my dear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How well you stand it, too! It's very queer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dreadful trials women have to carry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you can't always help it when you marry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, what a sweet layette! What lovely socks!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What an exquisite puff and powder box!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is your doctor? Yes, his skill's immense&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it's a dreadful danger and expense!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And so with love, and death, and work&mdash;all
are smutted and debased. And her revolt
is a revolt against that which smuts and
debases them&mdash;against those artificial
channels which break up the strong, pure
stream of woman's energy into a thousand
little stagnant canals, covered with spiritual
pond-scum.</p>

<p>It is a part of her idealism to conceive life
in terms of war. So it is that she scorns
compromise, for in war compromise is treason.
And so it is that she has heart for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
long, slow marshaling of forces, and the
dingy details of the commissariat&mdash;for
these things are necessary if the cry of victory
is ever to ring out over the battlefield.
Some of her phrases have so militant an air
that they seem to have been born among the
captains and the shouting. They make us
ashamed of our vicious civilian comfort.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gilman's attitude toward the bearing
and rearing of children is easy to misapprehend.
She does seem to relegate these
things to the background of women's lives.
She does deny to these things a tremendous
importance. Why, she asks, is it so important
that women should bear and rear children
to live lives as empty and poor as
their own? Surely, she says, it is more
important to make life something worth
giving to children! No, she insists, it is not
sufficient to be a mother: an oyster can be
a mother. It is necessary that a woman
should be a person as well as a mother. She
must know and do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>And as for the ideal of love which is
founded on masculine privilege, she satirizes
it very effectively in some verses entitled
"Wedded Bliss":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O come and be my mate!" said the Eagle to the Hen;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I love to soar, but then<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I want my mate to rest<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Forever in the nest!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Said the Hen, "I cannot fly<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I have no wish to try,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I joy to see my mate careering through the sky!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wed, and cried, "Ah, this is Love, my own!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Hen sat, the Eagle soared, alone.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Woman, in Mrs. Gilman's view, must not
be content with Hendom: the sky is her
province, too. Of all base domesticity, all
degrading love, she is the enemy. She gives
her approval only to that work which has in
it something high and free, and that love
which is the dalliance of the eagles.</p>

<h3><a name="EMMELINE_PANKHURST_AND_JANE_ADDAMS" id="EMMELINE_PANKHURST_AND_JANE_ADDAMS"></a>EMMELINE PANKHURST AND JANE ADDAMS</h3>


<p>A few months ago it was rather the
fashion to reply to some political
verses by Mr. Kipling which assumed to
show that women should not be given the
ballot, and which had as their refrain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The female of the species is more deadly than the male!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But it seems that no one pointed out that
this fact, even in the limited sense in which
it is a fact in the human species, is an argument
for giving women the vote.</p>

<p>For if women are, as Mr. Kipling says,
lacking in a sense of abstract justice, in
patience, in the spirit of compromise; if
they are violent and unscrupulous in gaining
an end upon which they have set their hearts,
then by all means they should be rendered
comparatively harmless by being given the
ballot. For it is characteristic of a republic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
that its political machinery, created in order
to carry out the will of the people, comes to
respond with difficulty to that will, while
being perfectly susceptible to other influences.
Republican government, when not
modified by drastic democratic devices, is an
expensive, cumbrous, and highly inefficient
method of carrying out the popular will;
and casting a vote is like nothing so much
as casting bread upon the waters. It shall
return&mdash;after many days. By voting, by
exercising an infinitesimal pressure on our
complex, slow-moving political mechanism,
one cannot&mdash;it is a sad fact&mdash;do much
good; but one cannot&mdash;and it should encourage
the pessimistic Mr. Kipling&mdash;one
cannot, even though a woman, do much
harm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>This is not, however, a disquisition on
woman suffrage. There is only one argument
for woman suffrage: women want it;
there are no arguments against it. But one
may profitably inquire, What will be the
effect of the emergence of women into politics
upon politics itself? And one may hope
to find an answer in the temperament and
career of certain representative leaders of
the woman's movement. Let us accordingly
turn to the accredited leader of the English
"votes for women" movement, and to the
woman in the American movement who is
best known to the public.</p>

<p>That Miss Jane Addams has become
known chiefly through other activities does
not matter here. It is temperament and
career in which we are immediately interested.
What is perhaps the most outstanding
fact in the temperament of Miss
Addams is revealed only indirectly in her
autobiography: it may be called the passion
of conciliation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst has by her actions
written herself down for a fighter. She
has but recently been released from Holloway
jail, where she was serving a term of
imprisonment for "conspiracy and violence."
In a book by H. G. Wells, which
contains a very bitter attack on the woman's
suffrage movement (I refer to "Ann Veronica"),
she is described as "implacable"; and
I believe that it is she to whom Mr. Wells
refers as being "as incapable of argument
as a steam roller broken loose." The same
things might have been said of Sherman on
his dreadful march to the sea. These
phrases, malicious as they are, contain what
I am inclined to accept as an accurate
description of Mrs. Pankhurst's temperament.</p>

<p>No one would call Mrs. Pankhurst a conciliator.
And no one would call Miss
Addams "implacable." It is not intended
to suggest that Miss Addams is one of those
inveterate compromisers who prefer a bad
peace to a good war. But she has the gift of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
imaginative sympathy; and it is impossible
for her to have toward either party in a conflict
the cold hostility which each party has
for the other. She sees both sides; and even
though one side is the wrong side, she cannot
help seeing why its partisans believe in it.</p>

<p>"If the under dog were always right,"
Miss Addams has said, "one might quite
easily try to defend him. The trouble is that
very often he is but obscurely right, sometimes
only partially right, and often quite
wrong, but perhaps he is never so altogether
wrong and pig-headed and utterly reprehensible
as he is represented to be by those who
add the possession of prejudice to the other
almost insuperable difficulties in understanding
him."</p>

<p>Miss Addams has taken in good faith the
social settlement ideal&mdash;"to span the gulf
between the rich and the poor, or between
those who have had cultural opportunities
and those who have not, by the process of
neighborliness." In her writings, as in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
work, there is never sounded the note of
defiance. Even in defense of the social settlement
and its methods of conciliation
(which have been venomously assailed by
the newspapers during Chicago's fits of temporary
insanity, as in the Averbuch case),
Miss Addams has not become militant. She
has never ceased to be serenely reasonable.</p>

<p>But when one comes to ask how powerful
Miss Addams' example has been, one is
forced to admit that it has been limited.
There are two other settlement houses in
Chicago which are managed in the spirit of
Hull House. But all the others&mdash;and there
are about forty settlement houses in the city&mdash;have
discarded almost openly the principle
of conciliation. They are efficient, or
religious, or something else, but they are
afraid of being too sympathetic with the
working class. They do not, for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
permit labor unions to meet in their halls.
The splendid social idealism of the '80s, of
which Miss Addams is representative, has
disappeared, leaving two sides angry and
hostile and with none but Miss Addams believing
in the possibility of finding any common
ground for action. One event after
another from the Pullman strike to the
Averbuch case has brought this hostility out
into the open, with Miss Addams occupying
neutral ground, and left high and dry
upon it.</p>

<p>It is the fact that Miss Addams has not
been able to imbue the movement in which
she is a leader with her own spirit. Her
career has been successful only so far as
individual genius could make it successful. If
one compares her achievement to that of
Mrs. Pankhurst, one sees that the latter is
startingly social in its nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>For Mrs. Pankhurst has called upon
women to be like herself, to display her own
Amazonian qualities. She called upon shop
girls and college students and wives and old
women to make physical assaults on cabinet
ministers, to raid parliament and fight
with policemen, to destroy property and go
to prison, to endure almost every indignity
from the mobs and from their jailers, to
suffer in health and perhaps to die, exactly
as soldiers suffer and die in a campaign.</p>

<p>And they did. They answered her call
by the thousands. They have fought and
suffered, and some of them have died. If
this had been the result of individual genius
in Mrs. Pankhurst, transforming peaceful
girls into fighters out of hand, she would be
the most extraordinary person of the age.
But it is impossible to believe that all this
militancy was created out of the void. It
was simply awakened where it lay sleeping
in these women's hearts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>Mrs. Pankhurst has performed no
miracle. She has only shown to us the truth
which we have blindly refused to see. She
has had the insight to recognize in women
generally the same fighting spirit which she
found in herself, and the courage to draw
upon it. She has enabled us to see what
women really are like, just as Miss Addams
has by her magnificent anomalies shown us
what women are not like.</p>

<p>Can anyone doubt this? Can anyone, seeing
the lone eminence of Miss Addams, assert
that imaginative sympathy, patience,
and the spirit of conciliation are the ordinary
traits of women? Can anyone, seeing the
battle frenzy which Mrs. Pankhurst has
evoked with a signal in thousands of
ordinary Englishwomen, deny that women have
a fighting soul?</p>

<p>And can anyone doubt the effect which
the emergence of women into politics will
have, eventually, on politics? Eventually,
for in spite of their boasted independence
the decorous example of men will rule them
at first. But when they have become used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to politics&mdash;well, we shall find that we have
harnessed an unruly Niagara!</p>

<p>In women as voters we shall have an element
impatient of restraint, straining at the
rules of procedure, cynical of excuses for
inaction; not always by any means on the
side of progress; making every mistake possible
to ignorance and self-conceit; but
transforming our politics from a vicious end
to an efficient means&mdash;from a cancer into
an organ.</p>

<p>This, with but little doubt, is the historic
mission of women. They will not escape a
certain taming by politics. But that they
should be permanently tamed I find impossible
to believe. Rather they will subdue it
to their purposes, remold it nearer to their
hearts' desire, change it as men would never
dream of changing it, wreck it savagely in
the face of our masculine protest and merrily
rebuild it anew in the face of our despair.
With their aid we may at last achieve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
what we seem to be unable to achieve unaided&mdash;a
democracy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile let us understand this suffrage
movement. Let us understand that we have
in militancy rather than in conciliation, in
action rather than in wisdom, the keynote of
woman in politics. And we males, who have
so long played in our politics at innocent
games of war, we shall have an opportunity
to fight in earnest at the side of the
Valkyrs.</p>

<h3><a name="OLIVE_SCHREINER_AND_ISADORA_DUNCAN" id="OLIVE_SCHREINER_AND_ISADORA_DUNCAN"></a>OLIVE SCHREINER AND ISADORA DUNCAN</h3>


<p>I hope that no one will see in the conjuncture
of these names a mere wanton
fantasy, or a mere sensational contrast. To
me there is something extraordinarily appropriate
in that conjuncture, inasmuch as
the work of Olive Schreiner and the work
of Isadora Duncan supplement each other.</p>

<p>It is the drawback of the woman's movement
that in any one of its aspects (heightened
and colored as such an aspect often is
by the violence of propaganda) it may appear
too fiercely narrow. That women
should make so much fuss about getting the
vote, or that they should so excite themselves
over the prospect of working for
wages, will appear incomprehensible to
many people who have a proper regard for
art, for literature, and for the graces of social
intercourse. It is only when the woman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
movement is seen broadly, in a variety of
its aspects, that there comes the realization
that here is a cause in which every fine aspiration
has a place, a cause from which
sincere lovers of truth and beauty have
nothing really to fear.</p>

<p>Mrs. Olive Schreiner stands, by virtue of
her latest book, "Women and Labor," as an
exponent of the doctrine that would send
women into every field of economic activity;
or, rather, the doctrine that finds in the
forces which are driving them there a savior
of her sex from the degradation of parasitism.
In behalf of this doctrine she has
expended all that eloquence and passion
which have made her one of the figures in
modern literature and a spokesman for all
women who have not learned to speak that
hieratic language which is heard, as the
inexpressive speech of daily life is not heard,
across space and time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>Miss Isadora Duncan stands as representative
of the renaissance in dancing. She
has brought back to us the antique beauty of
an art of which we have had only relics and
memento in classic sculpture and decoration.
She has made us despise the frigid artifice of
the ballet, and taught us that in the natural
movements of the body are contained the
highest possibilities of choregraphic beauty.
It has been to many of us one of the finest
experiences of our lives to see, for the first
time, the marble maiden of the Grecian urn
come to life in her, and all the leaf-fringed
legends of Arcady drift before our enamored
eyes. She has touched our lives with
the magic of immemorial loveliness.</p>

<p>But to class Olive Schreiner as a sociologist
and Isadora Duncan as a dancer, to
divorce them by any such categories, is to do
them both an injustice. For they are sister
workers in the woman's movement. They
have each shown the way to a new freedom
of the body and the soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>The woman's movement is a product of
the evolutionary science of the nineteenth
century. Women's rebellions there have
been before, utopian visions there have
been, which have contributed no little to the
modern movement by the force of their tradition
and ever-living spirit. No Joan of
Arc has led men to victory, no Lady Godiva
has sacrificed her modesty&mdash;nay, even, no
courtesan has taught a feeble king how to
rule his country&mdash;without feeding the flame
of feminine aspiration. But it is modern
science which, by giving us a new view of
the body, its functions, its needs, its claim
upon the world, has laid the basis for a successful
feminist movement. When the true
history of this movement is written it will
contain more about Herbert Spencer and
Walt Whitman, perhaps, than about Victoria
Woodhull and Tennessee Claflin. In
any case, it is to the body that one looks for
the Magna Charta of feminism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>The eye&mdash;that is to say&mdash;is guarantor
for the safety of art in a future r&eacute;gime under
the dominance of women; and the ear for
poetry. These have their functions and
their needs, and the woman of the future
will not deny them.</p>

<p>It is the hand that Olive Schreiner would
emancipate from idleness. She knows the
significance of the hand in human history.
It was by virtue of the hand that we, and
not some other creature, gained lordship
over the earth. It was the hand (marvelous
instrument, coaxing out of the directing will
an ever-increasing subtlety) that made possible
the human brain, and all the vistas of
reason and imagination by which our little
lives gain their peculiar grandeur.</p>

<p>And this hand, if it be a woman's in the
present day, is doomed to the smallest activities.
"Our spinning wheels are all broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
...Our hoes and grindstones passed from
us long ago.... Year by year, day by day,
there is a silently working but determined
tendency for the sphere of women's domestic
labors to contract itself." Even the training
of her child is taken away from the mother
by the "mighty and inexorable demands of
modern civilization." That condition is to
her intolerable; and it is on behalf of
women's empty hands that she makes her
demand: "that, in that strange new world
that is arising alike upon the man and the
woman, where nothing is as it was, and all
things are assuming new shapes and relations,
that in this new world we also shall
have our share of honored and socially useful
human toil, our full half of the labor of
the Children of Woman."</p>

<p>And what of Miss Duncan&mdash;what is her
part in the woman's movement? In her
book on "The Dance" she tells a story:
"A woman once asked me why I dance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
with bare feet, and I replied, 'Madam, I believe
in the religion of the beauty of the
human foot'; and the lady replied, 'But I
do not,' and I said: 'Yet you must, Madam,
for the expression and intelligence of the human
foot is one of the greatest triumphs of
the evolution of man.' 'But,' said the lady,
'I do not believe in the evolution of man.'
At this said I, 'My task is at an end. I
refer you to my most revered teachers, Mr.
Charles Darwin and Mr. Ernst Haeckel&mdash;'
'But,' said the lady, 'I do not believe in
Darwin and Haeckel&mdash;' At this point I
could think of nothing more to say. So you
see that, to convince people, I am of little
value and ought not to speak."</p>

<p>But rather to dance! Yet it is good to
find so explicit a statement of the idea
which she nobly expresses in her dancing.
For, as the hand is the symbol of that constructive
exertion of the body which we call
work, so is the foot the symbol of that diffusive
exertion of the body which we call
play. Isadora Duncan would emancipate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the one as Olive Schreiner would emancipate
the other&mdash;to new activities and new
delights.</p>

<p>And if such work is not a thing for itself
only, but a gateway to a new world, so is
such play not a thing for itself only. "It is
not only a question of true art," writes Miss
Duncan, "it is a question of race, of the development
of the female sex to beauty and
health, of the return to the original strength
and the natural movements of woman's
body. It is a question of the development
of perfect mothers and the birth of healthy
and beautiful children." Here we have an
inspiriting expression of the idea which
through the poems of Walt Whitman and
the writings of various moderns, has renovated
the modern soul and made us see, without
any obscene blurring by Puritan spectacles,
the goodness of the whole body. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
is as much a part of the woman's movement
as the demand for a vote (or, rather, it is
more central and essential a part); and only
by realizing this is it possible to understand
that movement.</p>

<p>The body is no longer to be separated in
the thought of women from the soul: "The
dancer of the future will be one whose body
and soul have grown so harmoniously
together that the natural language of that
soul will have become the movement of the
body. The dancer will not belong to a nation,
but to all humanity. She will dance,
not in the form of nymph, nor fairy, nor
coquette, but in the form of woman in its
greatest and purest expression. She will
realize the mission of woman's body and the
holiness of all its parts. She will dance the
changing life of nature, showing how each
part is transformed into the other. From
all parts of her body shall shine radiant intelligence,
bringing to the world the message
of the thoughts and aspirations of thousands
of women. She shall dance the freedom of
woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>"She will help womankind to a new
knowledge of the possible strength and
beauty of their bodies, and the relation of
their bodies to the earth nature and to the
children of the future. She will dance, the
body emerging again from centuries of civilized
forgetfulness, emerging not in the
nudity of primitive man, but in a new nakedness,
no longer at war with spirituality and
intelligence, but joining itself forever with
this intelligence in a glorious harmony.</p>

<p>"Oh, she is coming, the dancer of the
future; the free spirit, who will inhabit the
body of new women; more glorious than any
woman that has yet been; more beautiful
than the Egyptian, than the Greek, the early
Italian, than all women of past centuries&mdash;the
highest intelligence in the freest body!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>If the woman's movement means anything,
it means that women are demanding
everything. They will not exchange one
place for another, nor give up one right to
pay for another, but they will achieve all
rights to which their bodies and brains give
them an implicit title. They will have a
larger political life, a larger motherhood, a
larger social service, a larger love, and they
will reconstruct or destroy institutions to
that end as it becomes necessary. They will
not be content with any concession or any
triumph until they have conquered all
experience.</p>

<p>The careers of these two women serve
admirably to exhibit the woman's
movement in still another aspect, and to
throw light upon the essential nature of
woman's character. These careers stand in
plain contrast. Beatrice Webb has compiled
statistics, and Emma Goldman has
preached the gospel of freedom. It remains
to be shown which is the better and the more
characteristically feminine gift to the world.</p>

<p>Beatrice Potter was the daughter of a Canadian
railway president. Born in 1858, she
grew up in a time when revolutionary movements
were in the making. She was a pupil
of Herbert Spencer, and it was perhaps
from him that she learned so to respect her
natural interest in facts that the brilliancy
of no generalization could lure her into forgetting
them. At all events, she was captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
permanently by the magic of facts.
She studied working-class life in Lancashire
and East London at first hand, and in 1885
joined Charles Booth in his investigations
of English social conditions. These investigations
(which in my amateur ignorance I
always confused with those of General
Booth of the Salvation Army!) were published
in four large volumes entitled "Life
and Labor of the People." Miss Potter's
special contributions were articles on the
docks, the tailoring trade, and the Jewish
community. Later she published a book on
"The Co&#246;perative Movement in Great
Britain." Then, in 1892, she married Sidney
Webb, a man extraordinarily of her
own sort, and became confirmed, if such a
thing were necessary, in her statistical habit
of mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>Meanwhile, in 1883, the Fabian Society
had been founded. But first a word about
statistics. "Statistics" does not mean a
long list of figures. It means the spreading
of knowledge of facts. Statistics may be
called the dogma that knowledge is dynamic&mdash;that
it is somehow operative in bringing
about that great change which all intelligent
people desire (and which the Fabians conceived
as Socialism). The Fabian Society
was founded on the dogma of statistics as
on a rock. The Fabians did not start a
newspaper, nor create a new political party,
nor organize public meetings; but they
wrote to the newspapers already in existence,
ran for office on party tickets already
in the field, and made speeches to other organizations.
That is to say, they went about
like the cuckoo, laying their statistical eggs
in other people's nests and expecting to see
them hatch into enlightened public opinion
and progressive legislation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>Some of them hatched and some of them
didn't. The point is that we have in this
section of Beatrice Webb's career something
typical of herself. She has gone on, serving
on government commissions, writing (with
her husband) the history of Trades Unionism,
patiently collecting statistics and getting
them printed in black ink on white
paper, making detailed plans for the abolition
of poverty, and always concerning
herself with the homely fact.</p>

<p>At the time that Beatrice Potter joined
Mr. Booth in his social investigations there
was a 16-year-old Jewish girl living in the
German-Russian province of Kurland. A
year later, in 1886, this girl, Emma Goldman
by name, came to America, to escape
the inevitable persecutions attending on any
lover of liberty in Russia. She had been one
of those who had gone "to the people"; and
it was as a working girl that she came to
America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>She had, that is to say, the heightened
sensibilities, the keen sympathies, of the
middle class idealist, and the direct contact
with the harsh realities of our social and industrial
conditions which is the lot of the
worker. Her first experiences in America
disabused her of the traditional belief that
America was a refuge where the oppressed
of all lands were welcome. The treatment
of immigrants aboard ship, the humiliating
brutalities of the officials at Castle Garden,
and the insolent tyranny of the New York
police convinced her that she had simply
come from one oppressed land to another.</p>

<p>She went to work in a clothing factory,
her wages being $2.50 a week. She had
ample opportunities to see the degradations
of our economic system, especially as it affects
women. So it was not strange that
she should be drawn into the American labor
movement, which was then, with the Knights
of Labor, the eight-hour agitation, and the
propaganda of the Socialists and the Anarchists,
at its height. She became acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
with various radicals, read pamphlets and
books, and heard speeches. She was especially
influenced by the eloquent writings of
Johann Most in his journal Freiheit.</p>

<p>So little is known, and so much absurd
nonsense is believed, about the Anarchists,
that it is necessary to state dogmatically a
few facts. If these facts seem odd, the
reader is respectfully urged to verify them.
One fact is that secret organizations of
Anarchists plotting a violent overthrow of
the government do not exist, and never have
existed, save in the writings of Johann Most
and in the imagination of the police: the
whole spirit of Anarchism is opposed to such
organizations. Another fact is that Anarchists
do not believe in violence of any kind,
or in any exercise of force; when they commit
violence it is not as Anarchists, but as
outraged human beings. They believe that
violent reprisals are bound to be provoked
among workingmen by the tyrannies to
which they are subjected; but they abjure
alike the bomb and the policeman's club.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>There was a brief period in which Anarchists,
under the influence of Johann Most,
believed in (even if they did not practice)
the use of dynamite. But this period was
ended, in America, by the hanging of several
innocent men in Chicago in 1887; which at
least served the useful purpose of showing
radicals that it was a bad plan even to talk
of dynamite. And this hanging, which was
the end of what may be called the Anarchist
"boom" in this country, was the beginning
of Emma Goldman's career as a publicist.</p>

<p>Since 1887 the Anarchists have lost influence
among workingmen until they are
today negligible&mdash;unless one credits them
with Syndicalism&mdash;as a factor in the labor
movement. The Anarchists have, in fact,
left the industrial field more and more and
have entered into other kinds of propaganda.
They have especially "gone in for
kissing games."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>And Emma Goldman reflects, in her career,
the change in Anarchism. She has become
simply an advocate of freedom&mdash;freedom
of every sort. She does not advocate
violence any more than Ralph Waldo Emerson
advocated violence. It is, in fact, as an
essayist and speaker of the kind, if not the
quality, of Emerson, Thoreau, or George
Francis Train, that she is to be considered.</p>

<p>Aside from these activities (and the evading
of our overzealous police in times of
stress) she has worked as a trained nurse
and midwife; she conducted a kind of radical
salon in New York, frequented by such
people as John Swinton and Benjamin
Tucker; she traveled abroad to study social
conditions; she has become conversant with
such modern writings as those of Hauptmann,
Nietzsche, Ibsen, Zola, and Thomas
Hardy. It is stated that the "Rev. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Parkhurst, during the Lexow investigation,
did his utmost to induce her to join the
Vigilance Committee in order to fight Tammany
Hall." She was the manager of Paul
Orlenoff and Mme. Nazimova. She was a
friend of Ernest Crosby. Her library, it is
said, would be taken for that of a university
extension lecturer on literature.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that Emma Goldman
is of a type familiar enough in America, and
conceded a popular respect. She has a legitimate
social function&mdash;that of holding before
our eyes the ideal of freedom. She is
licensed to taunt us with our moral
cowardice, to plant in our souls the nettles
of remorse at having acquiesced so tamely
in the brutal artifice of present day society.</p>

<p>I submit the following passage from her
writings ("Anarchism and Other Essays")
as at once showing her difference from other
radicals and exhibiting the nature of her
appeal to her public:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>"The misfortune of woman is not that she
is unable to do the work of a man, but that
she is wasting her life force to outdo him,
with a tradition of centuries which has left
her physically incapable of keeping pace
with him. Oh, I know some have succeeded,
but at what cost, at what terrific cost! The
import is not the kind of work woman does,
but rather the quality of the work she furnishes.
She can give suffrage or the ballot
no new quality, nor can she receive anything
from it that will enhance her own quality.
Her development, her freedom, her independence,
must come from and through herself.
First, by asserting herself as a personality,
and not as a sex commodity. Second,
by refusing the right to anyone over her
body; by refusing to bear children unless
she wants them; by refusing to be a servant
to God, the State, society, the husband, the
family, etc.; by making her life simpler, but
deeper and richer. That is, by trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
learn the meaning and substance of life in
all its complexities, by freeing herself from
the fear of public opinion and public condemnation.
Only that, and not the ballot,
will set woman free, will make her a force
hitherto unknown in the world; a force for
real love, for peace, for harmony; a force
of divine fire, of life giving; a creator of
free men and women."</p>

<p>There is little in this that Ibsen would not
have said amen to. But&mdash;and this is the
conclusion to which my chapter draws&mdash;Ibsen
has said it already, and said it more
powerfully. Emma Goldman&mdash;who (if
among women anyone) should have for us
a message of her own, striking to the heart&mdash;repeats,
in a less effective cadence, what
she has learned from him.</p>

<p>The work of Beatrice Webb is the prose
of revolution. The work of Ibsen is its
poetry. Beatrice Webb has performed her
work&mdash;one comes to feel&mdash;as well as Ibsen
has his. And one wonders if, after all, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
prose is not that which women are best endowed
to succeed in.</p>

<p>A book review (written by a woman)
which I have at hand contains some generalizations
which bear on the subject.
"This is a woman's book [says the reviewer],
and a book which could only have
been written by a woman, though it is singularly
devoid of most of the qualities which
are usually recognized as feminine. For romance
and sentiment do not properly lie in
the woman's domain. She deals, when she
is herself, with the material facts of the life
she knows. Her talent is to exhibit them in
the remorseless light of reality and shorn of
all the glamour of idealism. Great and
poetical imagination rarely informs her art,
but within the strictness of its limits it lives
by an intense and scrupulous sincerity of
observation and an uncompromising recognition
of the logic of existence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>If that is true, shall we not then expect
a future more largely influenced by women
to have more of the hard, matter-of-fact
quality, the splendid realism characteristic
of woman "when she is herself"?</p>

<h3><a name="MARGARET_DREIER_ROBINS" id="MARGARET_DREIER_ROBINS"></a>MARGARET DREIER ROBINS</h3>


<p>The work of Margaret Dreier Robins
has been done in the National
Women's Trade Union League. It might
be supposed that the aim of such an organization
is sufficiently explicit in its title: to
get higher wages and shorter hours. But I
fancy that it would be a truer thing to say
that its aim is to bring into being that
ideal of American womanhood which Walt
Whitman described:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They are not one jot less than I am,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are tann'd in the face by shining suns and blowing winds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their flesh has the old divine suppleness and strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They know how to swim, row, ride, wrestle, shoot, run, strike, retreat, advance, resist, defend themselves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are ultimate in their own right&mdash;they are calm, clear, well-possessed of themselves.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>When Whitman made this magnificent
prophecy for American womanhood the
Civil War had not been fought and its economic
consequences were unguessed at. The
factory system, which had come into England
in the last century, bringing with it the
most unspeakable exploitation of women
and children, had hardly gained a foothold
in this country. In 1840, of the seven employments
open to women (teaching, needlework,
keeping boarders, working in cotton
mills, in bookbinderies, typesetting and
household service) only one was representative
of the new industrial condition which
today affects so profoundly the feminine
physique. And to the daughters of a nation
that was still imbued with the pioneer
spirit, work in cotton mills appealed so little
that they undertook it only for unusually
high pay. Anyone of that period seeing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
red-cheeked, robust, intelligent, happy girl
operatives of Lowell might have dismissed
his fears of the factory as a sinister influence
in the development of American womanhood
and gone on to dream, with Walt
Whitman, of a race of "fierce, athletic
girls."</p>

<p>But two things happened. With the
growing flood of immigration, the factories
were abandoned more and more to the
"foreigners," the native-born citizens losing
their pride in the excellence of working conditions
and the character of the operatives.
And all the while the factory was becoming
more and more an integral part of our civilization,
demanding larger and larger multitudes
of girls and women to attend its
machinery. So that, with the enormous development
of industry since the Civil War,
the factory has become the chief field of feminine
endeavor in America. In spite of the
great opening up of all sorts of work to
women, in spite of the store, the office, the
studio, the professions, still the factory remains
most important in any consideration
of the health and strength of women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>If the greatest part of our womankind
spends its life in factories, and if it further
appears that this is no temporary situation,
but (practically speaking) a permanent one,
then it becomes necessary to inquire how far
the factory is hindering the creation of that
ideal womanhood which Walt Whitman predicted
for us.</p>

<p>As opposed to the old-fashioned method
of manufacture in the home (or the sweatshop,
which is the modern equivalent), the
factory often shows a gain in light and air,
a decrease of effort, an added leisure; while,
on the other hand, there is a considerable loss
of individual freedom and an increase in monotony.
But child labor, a too long working
day, bad working conditions, lack of protection
from fire, personal exploitation by foremen,
inhumanly low wages, and all sorts of
petty injustice, though not essential to the
system, are prominent features of factory
work as it generally exists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>People who consider every factory an Inferno,
however, and have only pity for its
workers, are far from understanding the
situation. Here is a field of work which is
capable of competing successfully with domestic
service, and even of attracting girls
from homes where there exists no absolute
necessity for women's wages. Yet at its
contemporary best, with a ten-hour law in
operation, efficient factory inspection, decent
working conditions and a just and humane
management, the factory remains an institution
extremely perilous to the Whitmanic
ideal of womanhood.</p>

<p>But there are women who, undaunted by
the new conditions brought about by a
changing economic system, seize upon those
very conditions to use them as the means to
their end: such a woman is Mrs. Robins.
Has a new world, bounded by factory walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and noisy with the roar of machinery, grown
up about us, to keep women from their heritage?
She will help them to use those very
walls and that very machinery to achieve
their destiny, a destiny of which a physical
well-being is, as Walt Whitman knew it to
be, the most certain symbol.</p>

<p>The factory already gives women a certain
independence. It may yet give them
pleasure, the joy of creation. Indeed, it
must, when the workers require it; and those
who are most likely to require it are the
women workers.</p>

<p>It is well known that with the ultra-development
of the machine, the subdivision
of labor, the r&eacute;gime of piecework, it has
become practically impossible for the worker
to take any artistic pleasure in his product.
It is not so well known how necessary such
pleasure in the product is to the physical
well-being of women&mdash;how utterly disastrous
to their nervous organization is the
monotony and irresponsibility of piecework.
This method&mdash;which men workers have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
grumbled at, but to which they seem to have
adjusted themselves&mdash;bears its fruits
among women in neurasthenia, headaches,
and the derangement of the organs which are
the basis of their different nervous constitution.
It is sufficiently clear to those who
have seen the personal reactions of working
girls to the piecework system, that when
women attain, as men in various industries
have attained, the practical management of
the factory, piecework will get a setback.</p>

<p>But not merely good conditions, not
merely a living wage, not merely a ten or an
eight hour day&mdash;all that self-government in
the shop can bring is the object of the
Women's Trade Union League.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>"The chief social gain of the union shop,"
says Mrs. Robins, "is not its generally better
wages and shorter hours, but rather the
incentive it offers for initiative and social
leadership, the call it makes, through the
common industrial relationship and the common
hope, upon the moral and reasoning
faculties, and the sense of fellowship, independence
and group strength it develops.
In every workshop of say thirty girls there
is undreamed of initiative and capacity for
social leadership and control&mdash;unknown
wealth of intellectual and moral resources."</p>

<p>It is, in fact, this form of activity which to
many thousands of factory girls makes the
difference between living and existing, between
a painful, necessary drudgery and a
happy exertion of all their faculties. It can
give them a more useful education than any
school, a more vital faith than any church,
a more invigorating sense of power than any
other career open to them.</p>

<p>To do all these things it must be indigenous
to working-class soil. No benefaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
originating in the philanthropic motives of
middle-class people, no enterprise of patronage,
will ever have any such meaning. A
movement, to have such meaning, must be
of the working class, and by the working
class, as well as for the working class. It
must be imbued with working-class feeling,
and it must subserve working-class ideals.</p>

<p>It is the distinction of Mrs. Robins that
she has seen this. She has gone to the workers
to learn rather than to teach&mdash;she has
sought to unfold the ideals and capacities
latent in working girls rather than impress
upon them the alien ideals and capacities of
another class.</p>

<p>"Just"&mdash;it is Mrs. Robins that speaks&mdash;"as
under a despotic church and a feudal
state the possible power and beauty of the
common people was denied expression, so
under industrial feudalism the intellectual
and moral powers of the workers are slowly
choked to death, with incalculable loss to the
individual and the race. It is easy to kill; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
requires a great spirit as well as a great mind
to arouse the dormant energies, to vitalize
them and to make them creative forces for
good."</p>

<p>One is reminded of the words of John
Galsworthy, addressed to workingwomen:
"There is beginning to be a little light in the
sky; whether the sun is ever to break
through depends on your constancy, and
courage, and wisdom. The future is in your
hands more than in the hands of men; it
rests on your virtues and well-being, rather
than on the virtues and the welfare of men,
for it is you who produce and mold the Future."</p>

<p>There are 6,000,000 working women in
the United States, and half of them are girls
under 21. One may go out any day in
the city streets, at morning or noon or
evening, and look at a representative hundred
of them. The factories have not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
able to rob them of beauty and strength and
the charm of femininity, and in that beauty
and strength and charm there is a world of
promise. And that promise already begins
to be unfolded when to them comes Mrs.
Robins with a gospel germane to their natures,
saying, "Long enough have you
dreamed contemptible dreams."</p>

<h3><a name="ELLEN_KEY" id="ELLEN_KEY"></a>ELLEN KEY</h3>


<p>In these chapters a sincere attempt has
been made not so much to show what a
few exceptional women have accomplished
as to exhibit through a few prominent figures
the essential nature of women, and to show
what may be expected from a future in
which women will have a larger freedom
and a larger influence.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out that the peculiar
idealism of women is one that works itself
out through the materials of workaday life,
and which seeks to break or remake those
materials by way of fulfilling that idealism;
it has been shown that this idealism, as contrasted
with the more abstract and creative
idealism of men, deserves to be called practicalism,
a practicalism of a noble and beautiful
sort which we are far from appreciating;
and as complementing these forms of
activity, the play instinct, the instinct of
recreation, has been pointed out as the
parallel to the creative or poetic instinct of
men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>Woman as reconstructor of domestic
economics, woman as a destructive political
agent of enormous potency, woman as
worker, woman as dancer, woman as statistician,
woman as organizer of the forces of
labor&mdash;in these it has been the intent to
show the real woman of today and of tomorrow.</p>

<p>There have been other aspects of her deserving
of attention in such a series, notably
her aspect as mother and as educator. If
she has not been shown as poet, as artist, as
scientist, as talker (for talk is a thing quite
as important as poetry or science or art), it
has not been so much because of an actual
lack of specific examples of women distinguished
in these fields as because of the unrepresentative
character of such examples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>Here, then, is a man's view of modern
woman. To complete that view, to round off
that conception, I now speak of Ellen Key.</p>

<p>Her writings have had a peculiar career
in America, one which perhaps prevents a
clear understanding of their character. On
the one hand, they have seemed to many to
be radically "advanced"; to thousands of
middle-class women, who have heard vaguely
of these new ideas, and who have secretly
and strongly desired to know more of them,
her "Love and Marriage" has come as a
revolutionary document, the first outspoken
word of scorn for conventional morality, the
first call to them to take their part in the
breaking of new paths.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it must be remembered
that America is the home of Mormonism, of
the Oneida Community, of the Woodhull
and Claflin "free-love" movement of the
'70s, of "Dianism" and a hundred other
obscure but pervasive sexual cults&mdash;in
short, of movements of greater or less respectability,
capable of giving considerable
currency to their beliefs. And they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
given considerable currency to their beliefs.
In spite of the dominant tone of Puritanism
in American thought, our social life has been
affected to an appreciable extent by these
beliefs.</p>

<p>And these beliefs may be summed up
hastily, but, on the whole, justly, as materialistic&mdash;in
the common and unfavorable sense.
They have converged, from one direction or
another, upon the opinion that sex is an animal
function, no more sacred than any other
animal function, which, by a ridiculous over-estimation,
is made to give rise to jealousy,
unhappiness, madness, vice, and crime.</p>

<p>It is a fact that the Puritan temperament
readily finds this opinion, if not the program
which accompanies it, acceptable, as
one may discover in private conversation
with respectable Puritans of both sexes.
And it is more unfortunately true that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
present-day rebellion against conventional
morality in America has found, in Hardy
and Shaw and other anti-romanticists, a
seeming support of this opinion. So that one
finds in America today (though some people
may not know about it) an undercurrent
of impatient materialism in matters of sex.
To become freed from the inadequate morality
of Puritanism is, for thousands of young
people, to adopt another morality which is,
if more sound in many ways, certainly as
inadequate as the other.</p>

<p>So that Ellen Key comes into the lives of
many in this country as a conservative force,
holding up a spiritual ideal, the ideal of
monogamy, and defending it with a breadth
of view, a sanity, and a fervor that make it
something different from the cold institution
which these readers have come to despise.
She makes every allowance for human nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
every concession to the necessities of
temperament, every recognition of the
human need for freedom, and yet makes the
love of one man and one woman seem the
highest ideal, a thing worth striving and
waiting and suffering for.</p>

<p>She cherishes the spiritual magic of sex
as the finest achievement of the race, and
sees it as the central and guiding principle
in our social and economic evolution. She
seeks to construct a new morality which will
do what the present one only pretends, and
with the shallowest and most desperately
pitiful of pretenses, to do. She would help
our struggling generation to form a new
code of ethics, and one of subtle stringency,
in this most important and difficult of
relations.</p>

<p>Thus her writings, of which "Love and
Marriage" will here be taken as representative,
have a twofold aspect&mdash;the radical and
the conservative. But of the two, the conservative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
is by far the truer. It is as a
conservator, with too firm a grip on reality
to be lured into the desertion of any real
values so far achieved by the race, that she
may be best considered.</p>

<p>And germane to her conservatism, which
is the true conservatism of her sex, is her
intellectual habit, her literary method. She
is not a logician, it is true. She lacks
logic, and with it order and clearness and
precision, because of the very fact of her
firm hold on realities. The realities are too
complex to be brought into any completely
logical and orderly relation, too elusive to
be stated with utter precision. There is a
whole universe in "Love and Marriage";
and it resembles the universe in its wildness,
its tumultuousness, its contradictory quality.
Her book, like the universe, is in a state of
flux&mdash;it refuses to remain one fixed and
dead thing. It is a book which in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
some attempt at arrangement may be begun
at any point and read in any order. It is a
mixture of science, sociology, and mysticism;
it has a wider range than an orderly book
could possibly have; it touches more points,
includes more facts, and is more convincing,
in its queer way, than any other.</p>

<p>"Love and Marriage" is the Talmud of
sexual morality. It contains history, wisdom,
poetry, psychological analysis, shrewd
judgments, generous sympathies, ... and
it all bears upon the creation of that new
sexual morality for which in a thousand
ways&mdash;economic, artistic, and spiritual&mdash;we
are so astonishing a mixture of readiness
and unreadiness.</p>

<p>Ellen Key is fundamentally a conservator.
But she is careful about what she
conservates. It is the right to love which
she would have us cherish, rather than the
right to own another person&mdash;the beauty of
singleness of devotion rather than the cruel
habit of trying to force people to carry out
rash promises made in moments of exaltation.
She conserves the greatest things and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
lets the others go: motherhood, as against
the exclusive right of married women to
bear children; and that personal passion
which is at once physical and spiritual rather
than any of the legally standardized relations.
Nor does she hesitate to speak out
for the conservation of that old custom which
persists among peasant and primitive peoples
all over the world and which has been
reintroduced to the public by a recent sociologist
under the term of "trial marriage";
it must be held, she says, as the bulwark
against the corruption of prostitution and
made a part of the new morality.</p>

<p>It is perhaps in this very matter that her
attitude is capable of being most bitterly
resented. For we have lost our sense of
what is old and good, and we give the sanction
of ages to parvenu virtues that are as
degraded as the rococo ornaments which
were born in the same year. We have (or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the Puritans among us have) lost all moral
sense in the true meaning of the word, in
that we are unable to tell good from bad if
it be not among the things that were socially
respectable in the year 1860. Ellen Key
writes: "The most delicate test of a person's
sense of morality is his power in interpreting
ambiguous signs in the ethical
sphere; for only the profoundly moral can
discover the dividing line, sharp as the edge
of a sword, between new morality and old
immorality. In our time, ethical obtuseness
betrays itself first and foremost by the condemnation
of those young couples who freely
unite their destinies. The majority does not
perceive the advance in morality which this
implies in comparison with the code of so
many men who, without responsibility&mdash;and
without apparent risk&mdash;purchase the
repose of their senses. The free union of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
love, on the other hand, gives them an
enhancement of life which they consider that
they gain without injuring anyone. It answers
to their idea of love's chastity, an idea
which is justly offended by the incompleteness
of the period of engagement, with all
its losses in the freshness and frankness of
emotion. When their soul has found another
soul, when the senses of both have met
in a common longing, then they consider that
they have a right to full unity of love,
although compelled to secrecy, since the
conditions of society render early marriage
impossible. They are thus freed from a
wasteful struggle which would give them
neither peace nor inner purity, and which
would be doubly hard for them, since they
have attained the end&mdash;love&mdash;for the sake
of which self-control would have been
imposed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>It is almost impossible to quote any
passage from "Love and Marriage" which
is not subject to further practical modification,
or which does not present an incomplete
idea of which the complement may be
found somewhere else. Even this passage
is one which states a brief for the younger
generation rather than the author's whole
opinion. Still, with all these limitations, her
view is one which is so different from that
commonly held by women that it may seem
merely fantastic to hold it up as an example
of the conservative instinct of women.
Nevertheless, it is so. It must be remembered
that the view which holds that the
chastity of unmarried women is well purchased
at the price of prostitution, is a masculine
view. It is a piece of the sinister and
cruel idealism of the male mind, divorced (as
the male mind is so capable of being) from
realities. No woman would ever have created
prostitution to preserve the chastity of
part of her sex; and the more familiar one
becomes with the specific character of the
feminine mind, the more impossible does it
seem that women will, when they have come
to think and act for themselves, permanently
maintain it. Nor will they&mdash;one is forced
to believe&mdash;hesitate long at the implications
of that demolition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>No, I think that with the advent of
women into a larger life our jerry-built
virtues will have to go, to make room for
mansions and gardens fit to be inhabited by
the human soul.</p>

<p>It will be like the pulling down of a rotten
tenement. First (with a great shocked outcry
from some persons of my own sex) the
fa&#231;ade goes, looking nice enough, but showing
up for painted tin what pretended to
be marble; then the dark, cavelike rooms
exposed, with their blood-stained floors and
their walls ineffectually papered over the
accumulated filth and disease; and so on,
lath by lath, down to the cellars, with their
hints of unspeakable horrors in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>It is to this conclusion that these chapters
draw: That women have a surer instinct
than men for the preservation of the truest
human values, but that their very acts of
conservation will seem to the timid minds
among us like the shattering of all virtues,
the debacle of civilization, the G&#246;tterd&#228;mmerung!</p>

<h3><a name="FREEWOMEN_AND_DORA_MARSDEN" id="FREEWOMEN_AND_DORA_MARSDEN"></a>FREEWOMEN AND DORA MARSDEN</h3>


<p>This is by way of a postscript. Dora
Marsden is a new figure in the feminist
movement. Just how she evolved is
rather hard to say. Her family were Radicals,
it seems, smug British radicals; and
she broke away, first of all, into a sort of
middle class socialism. She went into settlement
work. Here, it seems, she discovered
what sort of person she really was.</p>

<p>She was a lover of freedom. So of course
she rebelled against the interference of the
middle class with the affairs of the poor, and
threw overboard her settlement work and
her socialism together. She was a believer
in woman suffrage, but the autocratic government
of the organization irked her.
And, besides, she felt constrained to point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
out that feminism meant worlds more than
a mere vote. The position of woman, not
indeed as the slave of man, but as the enslaver
of man, but with the other end of
the chain fastened to her own wrist, and
depriving her quite effectually of her liberties&mdash;this
irritated her. Independence to
her meant achievement, and when she heard
the talk about "motherhood" by which the
women she knew excused their lack of
achievement, she was annoyed. Finally, the
taboo upon the important subject of sex
exasperated her. So she started a journal
to express her discontent with all these
things, and to change them.</p>

<p>Naturally, she called her journal The
Freewoman. "Independent" expresses
much of Dora Marsden's feeling, but that
word has been of late dragged in a mire of
pettiness and needs dry cleaning. It has
come to signify a woman who isn't afraid to
go out at night alone or who holds a position
downtown. A word had to be chosen which
had in it some suggestion of the heroic.
Hence The Freewoman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>The Freewoman was a weekly. It lived
several months and then suspended publication,
and now all the women I know are
poring over the back numbers while waiting
for it to start again as a fortnightly. It was
a remarkable paper. For one thing, it
threw open its columns to such a discussion
of sex that dear Mrs. Humphry Ward wrote
a shocked letter to The Times about it. Of
course, a good many of the ideas put forth
in this correspondence were erroneous or
trivial, but it must have done the writers no
end of good to express themselves freely.
For once sex was on a plane with other subjects,
a fact making tremendously for sanity.
In this Miss Marsden not only achieved
a creditable journalistic feat, but performed
a valuable public service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>Her editorials were another distinctive
thing. In the first issue was an editorial
on "Bondwomen," from which it would appear
that perhaps even such advanced persons
as you, my dear lady, are still far from
free.</p>

<p>"Bondwomen are distinguished from
Freewomen by a spiritual distinction.
Bondwomen are the women who are not separate
spiritual entities&mdash;who are not individuals.
They are complements merely.
By habit of thought, by form of activity,
and largely by preference, they round off
the personality of some other individual,
rather than create or cultivate their own.
Most women, as far back as we have any
record, have fitted into this conception, and
it has borne itself out in instinctive working
practice.</p>

<p>"And in the midst of all this there
comes a cry that woman is an individual,
and that because she is an individual she
must be set free. It would be nearer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
truth to say that if she is an individual she
<i>is</i> free, and will act like those who are free.
The doubtful aspect in the situation is as to
whether women are or can be individuals&mdash;that
is, free&mdash;and whether there is not
danger, under the circumstances, in labelling
them free, thus giving them the liberty
of action which is allowed to the free. It
is this doubt and fear which is behind the
opposition which is being offered the vanguard
of those who are 'asking for' freedom.
It is the kind of fear which an engineer
would have in guaranteeing an arch equal
to a strain above its strength. The opponents
of the Freewomen are not actuated
by spleen or by stupidity, but by dread.
This dread is founded upon ages of experience
with a being who, however well loved,
has been known to be an inferior, and who
has accepted all the conditions of inferiors.
Women, women's intelligence, and women's
judgments have always been regarded with
more or less secret contempt, and when
woman now speaks of 'equality,' all the natural
contempt which a higher order feels for
a lower order when it presumes bursts out
into the open. This contempt rests upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
quite honest and sound instinct, so honest,
indeed, that it must provide all the charm
of an unaccustomed sensation for fine gentlemen
like the Curzons and Cromers and
Asquiths to feel anything quite so instinctive
and primitive.</p>

<p>"With the women opponents it is another
matter. These latter apart, however, it is
for would-be Freewomen to realize that for
them this contempt is the healthiest thing
in the world, and that those who express it
honestly feel it; that these opponents have
argued quite soundly that women have
allowed themselves to be used, ever since
there has been any record of them; and that
if women had had higher uses of their own
they would not have foregone them. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
have never known women to formulate imperious
wants, this in itself implying lack
of wants, and this in turn implying lack of
ideals. Women as a whole have shown
nothing save 'servant' attributes. All those
activities which presuppose the master qualities,
the standard-making, the law-giving,
the moral-framing, belong to men. Religions,
philosophies, legal codes, standards in
morals, canons in art, have all issued from
men, while women have been the 'followers,'
'believers,' the 'law-abiding,' the 'moral,' the
conventionally admiring. They have been
the administrators, the servants, living by
borrowed precept, receiving orders, doing
hodmen's work. For note, though some
men must be servants, all women are servants,
and all the masters are men. That is
the difference and distinction. The servile
condition is common to all women."</p>

<p>This was only the beginning of such a
campaign of radical propaganda as feminism
never knew before. Miss Marsden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
went on to attack all the things which bind
women and keep them unfree. As such she
denounced what she considered the cant of
"motherhood."</p>

<p>"Considering, therefore, that children,
from both physiological and psychological
points of view, belong more to the woman
than to the man; considering, too, that not
only does she need them more, but, as a
rule, wants them more than the man,
the parental situation begins to present elements
of humor when the woman proceeds
to fasten upon the man, in return for the
children she has borne him, the obligation
from that time to the end of her days, not
only for the children's existence, but for her
own, also!"</p>

<p>When asked under what conditions, then,
women should have children, she replied
that women who wanted them should save
for them as for a trip to Europe. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
frankly a gospel for a minority&mdash;a fact
which does not invalidate it in the eyes of
its promulgator&mdash;but she does believe that
if women are to become the equals of men
they must find some way to have children
without giving up the rest of life. It has
been done!</p>

<p>Then, having been rebuked for her critical
attitude toward the woman suffrage organization,
she showed herself in no mood to
take orders from even that source. She subjected
the attitude of the members of the
organization to an examination, and found
it tainted with sentimentalism. "Of all the
corruptions to which the woman's movement
is now open," she wrote, "the most poisonous
and permeating is that which flows from
sentimentalism, and it is in the W. S. P. U.
[Women's Social and Political Union]
that sentimentalism is now rampant....
It is this sentimentalism that is abhorrent
to us. We fight it as we would fight prostitution,
or any other social disease."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>She called upon women to be individuals,
and sought to demolish in their minds any
lingering desire for Authority. "There is,"
she wrote, "a genuine pathos in our reliance
upon the law in regard to the affairs
of our own souls. Our belief in ourselves
and in our impulses is so frail that we prefer
to see it buttressed up. We are surer of
our beliefs when we see their lawfulness
symbolized in the respectable blue cloth of
the policeman's uniform, and the sturdy
good quality of the prison's walls. The law
gives them their passport. Well, perhaps
in this generation, for all save pioneers, the
law will continue to give its protecting shelter,
but with the younger generations we
believe we shall see a stronger, prouder, and
more insistent people, surer of themselves
and of the pureness of their own desires."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>She did not stick at the task of formulating
for women a new moral attitude to
replace the old. "We are seeking," she
said, "a morality which shall be able to point
the way out of the social trap we find we
are in. We are conscious that we are concerned
in the dissolution of one social order,
which is giving way to another. Men and
women are both involved, but women differently
from men, because women themselves
are very different from men. The
difference between men and women is the
whole difference between a religion and a
moral code. Men are pagan. They have
never been Christian. Women are wholly
Christian, and have assimilated the entire
genius of Christianity.</p>

<p>"The ideal of conduct which men have
followed has been one of self-realization,
tempered by a broad principle of equity
which has been translated into practice by
means of a code of laws. A man's desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and ideal has been to satisfy the wants which
a consciousness of his several senses gives
rise to. His vision of attainment has therefore
been a sensuous one, and if in his desire
for attainment he has transgressed the law,
his transgression has sat but lightly upon
him. A law is an objective thing, laid upon
a man's will from outside. It does not enter
the inner recesses of consciousness, as does
a religion. It is nothing more than a body
of prohibitions and commands, which can
be obeyed, transgressed or evaded with little
injury to the soul. With women moral matters
have been wholly different. Resting
for support upon a religion, their moral
code has received its sanction and force from
within. It has thus laid hold on consciousness
with a far more tenacious grip. Their
code being subjective, transgression has
meant a darkening of the spirit, a sullying
of the soul. Thus the doctrine of self-renunciation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
which is the outstanding feature
of Christian ethics, has had the most
favorable circumstances to insure its realization,
and with women it has won completely&mdash;so
completely that it now exerts
its influence unconsciously. Seeking the
realization of the will of others, and not
their own, ever waiting upon the minds of
others, women have almost lost the instinct
for self-realization, the instinct for achievement
in their own persons."</p>

<p>Whether she is right is a moot question.
Certainly in such matters as testimony in
court, the customs-tariff, and the minor city
ordinances, women show no particular respect
for the law. Ibsen sought in "The
Doll's House" to show that her morality
had no connection with the laws of the world
of men. Even in matters of human relationship
it is doubtful if women give any
more of an "inner assent" to law than do
men. Woman's failure to achieve that domination
of the world which constitutes individuality
and freedom&mdash;this Dora Marsden
would explain on the ground of a dulling
of the senses. It may be more easily explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
as a result of a dulling of the imagination.
The trouble is that they are content
with petty conquests.</p>

<p>There you have it! Inevitably one argues
with Dora Marsden. That is her value.
She provokes thought. And she welcomes
it. She wants everybody to think&mdash;not to
think her thoughts necessarily, nor the right
thoughts always, but that which they can
and must. She is a propagandist, it is true.
But she does not create a silence, and call
it conversion.</p>

<p>She stimulates her readers to cast out the
devils that inhabit their souls&mdash;fear, prejudice,
sensitiveness. She helps them to build
up their lives on a basis of will&mdash;the exercise,
not the suppression, of will. She indurates
them to the world. She liberates them
to life. She is the Max Stirner of feminism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>Freedom! That is the first word and the
last with Dora Marsden. She makes women
understand for the first time what freedom
means. She makes them want to be free.
She nerves them to the effort of emancipation.
She sows in a fertile soil the dragon's
teeth which shall spring up as a band of
capable females, knowing what they want
and taking it, asking no leave from anybody,
doing things and enjoying life&mdash;Freewomen!</p>
